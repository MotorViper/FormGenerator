Anatomy of a token

Name: Value
	Attribute: Value
	Value:

So the child of a token can have a value of it's own. If it does it's an attribute. If not it's a value, the Value may be a list of items.
Attributes and Values can be tokens. In fact they are stored as tokens so they can be parsed at run time.

Each token also contains its parent.

When parsing a token the Attributes are checked first, then the attributes of the Value. If no value is found the parent is checked.
If the Value is a list then a list is returned.

	Damage: D6
